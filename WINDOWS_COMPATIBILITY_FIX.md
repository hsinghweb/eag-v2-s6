# Windows Compatibility Fix

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: UnboundLocalError in decision.py
**Problem:** Variable `actions_summary` was used outside its scope, causing:
```python
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'actions_summary' where it is not associated with a value
```

**Root Cause:** The variable was defined inside an `if previous_actions:` block but used outside it.

**Solution:** Moved the prompt concatenation inside the if block:
```python
if previous_actions:
    actions_summary = [...]
    prompt += "\n\nPrevious actions completed:\n" + "\n".join(actions_summary)
    prompt += "\n\nContinue from where you left off."
```

### Issue 2: UnicodeEncodeError on Windows Console
**Problem:** Windows console (cp1252 encoding) cannot display Unicode emoji characters:
```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\U0001f9e0' in position 33
```

**Emojis Affected:**
- 🧠 (Brain)
- 👁️ (Eye)
- 🧭 (Compass)
- 🎯 (Target)
- 🚀 (Rocket)
- 🔄 (Arrows)
- ✅ (Check mark)
- 📝 (Memo)
- 🔍 (Magnifying glass)
- ❌ (Cross mark)
- 📂 (Folder)
- 💾 (Floppy disk)
- 🗑️ (Wastebasket)

**Solution:** Replaced all emojis with text labels in brackets:
- `🧠` → `[MEMORY]`
- `👁️` → `[PERCEIVE]`
- `🧭` → `[DECISION]`
- `🎯` → `[ACTION]`
- `🚀` → `[AGENT]`
- ` ✅` → (removed, used context)
- `📝` → (kept in context)
- etc.

## Files Modified

1. **agent/decision.py**
   - Fixed `actions_summary` scope issue
   - Replaced decision layer emojis

2. **agent/perception.py**
   - Replaced perception layer emojis

3. **agent/memory.py**
   - Replaced memory layer emojis

4. **agent/action.py**
   - Replaced action layer emojis

5. **agent/ai_agent.py**
   - Replaced orchestrator emojis

## New Logging Format

### Before (with emojis):
```
🧠 Cognitive Agent initialized with 4 layers
👁️  PERCEIVING: add 3 and 5
✅ Perception complete - Intent: calculation
```

### After (text labels):
```
[AGENT] Cognitive Agent initialized with 4 layers
[PERCEIVE] Analyzing query: add 3 and 5
[PERCEIVE] Complete - Intent: calculation
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Windows compatibility** - Works on all Windows console encodings
2. ✅ **Easier to grep/search** - Text labels are searchable
3. ✅ **Professional logging** - Looks cleaner in production logs
4. ✅ **IDE compatibility** - Works in all terminals and IDEs

## Testing

The agent should now work correctly on Windows:
```bash
# Test it
uv run .\server.py

# Or directly
python agent\ai_agent.py
```

Query: "add 3 and 5 and send result in email"

Expected flow:
1. `[PERCEIVE]` - Extract intent, entities, facts
2. `[MEMORY]` - Store and retrieve facts
3. `[DECISION]` - Plan action steps
4. `[ACTION]` - Execute tools
5. `[AGENT]` - Complete successfully

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All functionality preserved - only logging format changed
✅ Chrome extension still works
✅ Flask server still works
✅ MCP tools still work
✅ Memory persistence still works

The cognitive architecture operates identically, just with cleaner Windows-compatible logging!
