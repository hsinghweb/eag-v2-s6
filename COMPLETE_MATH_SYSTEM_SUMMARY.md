## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Memory System
```python
# Old behavior (single file for all sessions)
memory_file = "logs/agent_memory.json"

# New behavior (timestamped per session)
memory_file = f"logs/agent_memory_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}.json"

# Each call creates fresh memory
MemoryLayer(memory_file=memory_file, load_existing=False)
```

### Tool Organization
```python
# Old structure
server_mcp/
  tools.py  # All tools mixed together

# New structure (organized by category)
server_mcp/
  tools_arithmetic.py   # 33 arithmetic tools
  tools_logical.py      # 10 logical tools
  tools_algebra.py      # 12 algebra tools
  tools_geometry.py     # 19 geometry tools
  tools_statistics.py   # 16 statistics tools
```

### MCP Tool Pattern
```python
# Consistent pattern for all tools
@mcp.tool()
def t_<operation_name>(input: <InputModel>) -> <OutputModel>:
    """<Description>"""
    logger.info(f"Calling t_<operation_name>(...)")
    result = <operation_function>(...)
    return <OutputModel>(result=result)
```

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Test Each Category

1. **Logical**
   ```
   "If A is true and B is false, what is A OR B?"
   "Evaluate: (True AND True) OR (False AND True)"
   ```

2. **Arithmetic**
   ```
   "Is 89 a prime number?"
   "What is the GCD of 36 and 48?"
   "Convert 0.625 to a fraction"
   ```

3. **Algebra**
   ```
   "Solve x² - 7x + 12 = 0"
   "Find the 8th term in geometric sequence starting at 2 with ratio 3"
   ```

4. **Geometry**
   ```
   "A rectangle has length 12 and width 5. What is its perimeter?"
   "What is the surface area of a cube with side length 4?"
   ```

5. **Statistics**
   ```
   "Find the median of 15, 8, 22, 11, 19"
   "Calculate the variance of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25"
   ```

### Test Memory System
1. Make a query with math_ability = "geometry"
2. Check that `logs/agent_memory_<timestamp>.json` is created
3. Verify file contains:
   - `user_preferences.math_ability: "geometry"`
   - `context.initial_query: "<your query>"`
4. Make another query
5. Verify a NEW timestamped memory file is created

## 📖 Usage from Chrome Extension

```javascript
// User selects math ability
const mathAbility = "geometry";  // or "arithmetic", "algebra", "statistics", "logical"

// User enters query
const query = "A circle has radius 10. What is its area?";

// Extension sends to API
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/query', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: query,
    preferences: {
      math_ability: mathAbility
    }
  })
});

// Agent creates timestamped memory file
// Selects appropriate tools based on math_ability
// Returns result: "The area is approximately 314.16"
```

## 🎓 Example Workflow

### User Journey
1. **User opens Chrome extension**
2. **Selects math ability:** "Statistics"
3. **Enters query:** "What is the average of 85, 90, 78, 92, 88?"
4. **System processes:**
   - Creates `agent_memory_20251020_150423.json`
   - Stores `math_ability: "statistics"`
   - Stores `initial_query: "What is the average..."`
   - Perception layer extracts: numbers [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]
   - Decision layer selects: `t_mean` tool
   - Action layer executes: `calculate_mean([85, 90, 78, 92, 88])`
   - Returns: 86.6
5. **User receives:** "The average is 86.6"

### Memory File Contents
```json
{
  "facts": [
    {
      "content": "User preference: math_ability = statistics",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-20T15:04:23",
      "source": "user_preferences",
      "relevance_score": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "context": {
    "initial_query": "What is the average of 85, 90, 78, 92, 88?"
  },
  "user_preferences": {
    "math_ability": "statistics"
  },
  "conversation_summary": ""
