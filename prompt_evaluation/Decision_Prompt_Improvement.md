```

**Score: 6/8 criteria met**

### ✅ AFTER Enhancement
```json
{
  "explicit_reasoning": true,
  "structured_output": true,

  "overall_clarity": "Excellent prompt with comprehensive reasoning, self-verification, error handling, and clear fallback strategies. Fully supports robust decision-making with internal validation."
}
```

**Score: 8/8 criteria met ✅ PERFECT SCORE**

---

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. ✅ Internal Self-Checks (ADDED)

**New Section in JSON Schema:**
```json
"self_check": {
    "plan_verified": true|false,
    "tools_available": true|false,
    "parameters_complete": true|false,
    "reasoning": "self-verification explanation"
}
```

**New Instructions:**
```
**Self-Check Instructions:**
- ALWAYS verify: Are all required tools available? Are parameters complete? Is the plan logically sound?
- Set plan_verified=false if you detect issues; explain why in reasoning
```

**Impact:**
- LLM now explicitly validates its own plan before execution
- Catches parameter issues, missing tools, or logical flaws early
- Provides reasoning for why a plan is or isn't verified

### 2. ✅ Fallback/Error Handling (ADDED)

**New Section in JSON Schema:**
```json
"fallback_plan": {
    "has_fallback": true|false,
    "fallback_steps": [
        {
            "condition": "when to use this fallback",
            "alternative_action": "what to do instead",
            "tool_name": "alternative tool if applicable or null"
        }
    ],
    "error_handling": "what to do if tools fail"
}
```

**New Instructions:**
```
**Fallback Instructions:**
- For tool calls: Provide alternative approaches if the primary tool fails
- For uncertain operations: Specify what to return to the user
- For missing parameters: Define how to request clarification
```

**Impact:**
- LLM proactively plans for failure scenarios
- Alternative tools/approaches specified upfront
- User communication strategy defined for errors

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Responsibilities Section (ADDED)

**New Framing:**
```
**Your Responsibilities:**
1. Analyze the perception and create a step-by-step action plan
2. Self-verify your plan for correctness and completeness
3. Prepare fallback strategies for potential failures
```

**Impact:**
- Clear expectations for the LLM's role
- Emphasizes proactive thinking (self-verification, fallback planning)
- Frames decision-making as a comprehensive process

## Example Output Comparison

### BEFORE (Missing Self-Check & Fallbacks)
```json
{
    "action_plan": [
        {
            "step_number": 1,
            "action_type": "tool_call",
            "description": "Add 2 and 3",
            "tool_name": "add",
            "parameters": {"input": {"a": 2, "b": 3}},
            "reasoning": "User requested addition"
        }
    ],
    "reasoning": "Simple addition operation",
    "expected_outcome": "Return sum of 5",
    "confidence": 1.0,
    "should_continue": false
}
```

### AFTER (With Self-Check & Fallbacks)
```json
{
    "action_plan": [
        {
            "step_number": 1,
            "action_type": "tool_call",
            "description": "Add 2 and 3",
            "tool_name": "add",
            "parameters": {"input": {"a": 2, "b": 3}},
            "reasoning": "User requested addition"
        }
    ],
    "reasoning": "Simple addition operation",
    "expected_outcome": "Return sum of 5",
    "confidence": 1.0,
    "should_continue": false,
    "self_check": {
        "plan_verified": true,
        "tools_available": true,
        "parameters_complete": true,
        "reasoning": "Add tool is available, parameters a=2 and b=3 are complete, plan is logically sound"
    },
    "fallback_plan": {
        "has_fallback": true,
        "fallback_steps": [
            {
                "condition": "If 'add' tool fails",
                "alternative_action": "Use basic_arithmetic tool with operation='add'",
                "tool_name": "basic_arithmetic"
            }
        ],
        "error_handling": "If both tools fail, return error message to user requesting manual calculation"
    }
}
```

## Benefits of Enhanced Prompt

### 1. **Proactive Error Prevention**
- LLM catches issues before execution
- Reduces wasted iterations on invalid plans

### 2. **Improved Robustness**
- Alternative strategies prepared in advance
- Graceful degradation when tools fail

### 3. **Better Debugging**
- Self-check reasoning reveals LLM's thought process
- Easier to identify where decision-making went wrong

### 4. **User Experience**
- More reliable outcomes
- Better error messages (defined in fallback)
- Fewer "stuck" states

### 5. **Compliance with Best Practices**
- Aligns with Chain-of-Thought prompting
- Implements ReAct pattern (Reasoning + Acting)
- Follows self-consistency principles

## Validation Against Pydantic Models

The enhanced prompt now fully utilizes existing Pydantic models:

### `SelfCheckDecision` (agent/models.py:227-232)
```python
class SelfCheckDecision(BaseModel):
    plan_verified: bool
    tools_available: bool
    parameters_complete: bool
    reasoning: str
```
✅ **Now actively used by the prompt**

### `FallbackPlan` (agent/models.py:235-239)
```python
class FallbackPlan(BaseModel):
    has_fallback: bool
    fallback_steps: List[FallbackStep]
    error_handling: str
```
✅ **Now actively used by the prompt**

**Before:** Models existed but weren't leveraged
**After:** Prompt explicitly instructs LLM to populate these fields

## Testing the Enhanced Prompt

### Test Case 1: Simple Query
**Query:** "add 2 and 3"
**Expected:** 
- Self-check confirms tools available
- Fallback defines alternative arithmetic methods
- Result: 5

### Test Case 2: Complex Query
**Query:** "solve x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 and send results via email"
**Expected:**
- Self-check verifies equation solver AND email tool available
- Fallback defines what to do if solver fails (e.g., use quadratic formula tool)
- Fallback defines what to do if email fails (e.g., return results only)

### Test Case 3: Uncertain Query
**Query:** "calculate something with unclear parameters"
**Expected:**
- Self-check identifies parameters_complete=false
- Fallback defines clarification request to user
- No tool execution until clarified

---

## Conclusion

The enhanced Decision Layer prompt now achieves a **perfect 8/8 score** on all evaluation criteria:

✅ Explicit Reasoning Instructions
✅ Structured Output Format
✅ Separation of Reasoning and Tools
✅ Conversation Loop Support
✅ Instructional Framing
✅ **Internal Self-Checks** (NEW)
✅ Reasoning Type Awareness
✅ **Error Handling or Fallbacks** (NEW)

This makes the agent significantly more robust, reliable, and maintainable.
